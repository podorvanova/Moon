## Welcome!
Hi, I am Maria Podorvanova from Canberra, Australia, and I am newly accepted [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) intern at Apache. 
In this blog I am going to write about my journey through Outreachy'21 winter internship.
This winter (or Australian summer) I'll be working on the project "Add a datastore for Elasticsearch in Apache Gora". 

## About the Project
The main objective of this project is to add support for Elasticsearch in Apache Gora, which is one of the most used text search engines nowadays.
I will be implementing the connection and mappings required for Elasticsearch to work in Apache Gora and Gora Explorer.
All project tasks are listed on [cwiki.apache.org](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GORA/Outreachy%3A+December+2020+-+March+2021).
Once I start working on any of them, I'll try to describe it here in more details.

## Contact Information
You can send me an [email](mailto:podorvanova.maria@gmail.com).
